\section{Naive sampling}

$n$ components, each with probability $p$,

$$Prob(success)= p^n$$

For $p=\frac{1}{2}$ and $n=100$, $2^{-100}=8\cdot 10^{-31}$ ($1kg/mass$)

% Use "\centering" in floats (figure, table), but if you need to center
% some text (why?) use "\begin{center}...\end{center}".
\centering 
% Figure environments same as 0.8 * \textwidth please
% That does not necessarily mean the actual picture size,
% it is a guideline for the environment which could contain
% 2 or more pictures! Be consistent and follow the guidelines
% provided in your sources.

% if you move the label it breaks the reference numbering; 
% always have it *after* the caption.

Remember how to include code with {\tt verbatim} 
and to fix the tabs in {\sf python} in a verbatim environment? 
It may be best to have an `include' command for code, 
not to have to re-edit it all the time.
\verbatimtabinput{code/mycode.py}
